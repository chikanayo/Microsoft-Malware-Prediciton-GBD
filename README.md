# Microsoft Malware Prediciton Using Gradient Boosted Decision Trees

This was my quasi-entry (didn't want to submit it, just for personal curiosity) for the Microsoft Malware Prediction challenge. The challenge page can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction .

Data is found in the data folder or on https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction/data . For this project I only used 2 million rows of data (as opposed to the 8.9 million rows of training data) for training and testing (80-20 split). I only used 2 million because anything larger was taking too long and/or resulting in memory error for my 16 gb RAM PC.

In lieu of an actual submission to get an accuracy score, I used the data from the 20 % testing split as my submission and used that to calculate an AUC score. Final score came out to be 0.644 - winning AUC was 0.71.

Model used was gradient boosted decision trees. 

Future optimizations may involve iterating over the gradient boosted classifier parameters to find optimal solutions. Another could be finding a way to run processes using larger data files successfully
